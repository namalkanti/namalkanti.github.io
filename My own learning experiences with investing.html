<p><a name="overview"></a></p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Since college, I've been mainly using a robo-advisor(Betterment) that I only started
using because of a deal they offered. </p>
<p>In the ensuing years; I've definitely made money from their investment selections
and I've never felt their fees have been too high. However, a number of personal events
and changing circumstances have motivated me to put this under closer evaluation
and make better use of my money.</p>
<p>I know I have zero interest in options and day trading; as is my pattern I would rather spend a lot 
of time up front learning and then sit back and let investments grow.</p>
<p>Through google searches, reviews, and forums I found a list of books that seem like a good places to 
start; they are as follows</p>
<p>Guide to Mutual Funds - Postive reviews, but some reviews accuse of simplicity; seems like a good start</p>
<p>"Dummies" Series for Mutual Funds, ETFs, and Bonds - I anticipate these will be what I invest in</p>
<p>Common Sense of Mutual Funds - Good reviews but long and boring; a later read after I have an initial understanding</p>
<p>A Simple Path to Wealth - I like overcomplicating things; this feels like a good step back for after a ton of dense, technical reading</p>
<p>Advanced Portfolio Management - Quant book if I want to try this</p>
<p>One key detail I want to learn is not just how to pick funds and build a portfolio, but how
to determine risk and assess based on financial goals. I know different goals will have different approaches
and I doubt it's as simple as "more/less stocks"</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Determine how to set my own financial goals</li>
<li>Determine how to make my a portfolio and organize my own investments for different goals</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="12/24/2023"></a></p>
<h1>12/24/2023 - Guide to Mutual Funds</h1>
<p>Book is by a group, Moringstar, they rate mutual funds and provides investment advice</p>
<p>Book is from before 2008; so it will not discuss that crash, which is interesting</p>
<p>Reviews suggest book is too simple, but for me it might be a good starting point</p>
<p><a name="12/27/2023"></a></p>
<h1>12/27/2023 - GtMF: Picking Mutual Funds</h1>
<p>Book is definitely not too simple for me right now</p>
<p>Moringstar Style Box classifies mutual funds based on size and growth vs value</p>
<p>Discussion of growth vs value</p>
<p>Discuss style investing</p>
<p>Risk</p>
<p>Fund manager analysis</p>
<p>KEY- You know your future expense ratio and costs; you don't know your future return(windshield vs rear view mirror)</p>
<p><a name="12/29/2023"></a></p>
<h1>12/29/2023 - GtMF: Portfolio Ideas, Building, and Monitoring</h1>
<p>Brings up the idea of a "core holding" the basis of a porfolio. Usually growth or value fund for stocks</p>
<p>Fund prospectuses are good resources for funds; but can very complicated</p>
<p>Bonds are either treasuries or municipal. Muncipal bonds can be tax free; VERY important if you're in a high tax bracket</p>
<p>Goes into extreme detail of specialized funds to use as auxillaries for both stocks and bonds</p>
<p>Recognize that buy and hold is better; DON'T time the market</p>
<p>Goes into detail for how to make portfolios for different goals. THIS IS WHAT I WANTED</p>
<p>Indexing and checkups</p>
<p>Best kind of advisor is time based one</p>
<p><a name="12/31/2023"></a></p>
<h1>12/31/2023 - GtMF: Review</h1>
<p>Very good introduction</p>
<p>Not sure how good morningstar is, but good place to start</p>
<p>Good learnings with growth vs value, importance of expense ratios. Value of indexing</p>
<p><a name="1/1/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/1/2024 - Mutual Funds for Dummies</h1>
<p>Good start; reviewing mutual funds; what they are; drawbacks, etc</p>
<p>AGAIN, costs of mutual funds are huge; biggest drawback is not paying attention to your costs(where have i heard this before?)</p>
<p>Notes importances of paying off debts, having insurance, emergency funds, etc before investingj</p>
<p><a name="1/3/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/3/2024 - MFfD: Funds and Alternatives</h1>
<p>Two different types of securities "ownwership" and "lending".</p>
<p>Does not reccomend individiual stocks; difficulty and diversifying is hard. Makes sense; I want to have a life</p>
<p>ETFs; a lot of good points for ETFs. Author claims they're too complicated and most people shouldn't bother. I don't know if I 
like this. There are a lot of pros; but a big one is buy/ask spread</p>
<p>Hedge Funds have high costs and the author claims they are too complicated and too hard to enter anyways. Agree they're too hard
but I don't like ignoring something just because it's too complicated(index funds have demonstrated value of simplicity but it shouldn't be automatic)</p>
<p>Rules about advisors</p>
<p><a name="1/5/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/5/2024 - MFfD: Selection, Crafting, and Monitoring</h1>
<p>Good stuff on indetinfying funds; morningstart referenced again; I guess it is a good resource</p>
<p>Prospectuses(discussed previously, brought up again)</p>
<p>Where to buy funds</p>
<p>Understanding asset allocation</p>
<p>Different types of funds MMF, Stocks, Bonds, Specialties</p>
<p>Taxes</p>
<p><a name="1/7/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/7/2024 - MFfD: review</h1>
<p>Good informaiton; understand mutual funds; how to proceed with them; asset allocation works well with
what I learned from Morningstar</p>
<p>Again, buying and holding index funds with some diversification is key</p>
<p><a name="1/8/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/8/2024 - Exchange-Traded-Funds for Dummies</h1>
<p>Excited to finall learn more about Exchange Traded Funds, which have come up a lot
but are still a little unclear to me </p>
<p>Very interested to understand pros and cons vs mutual funds</p>
<p><a name="1/9/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/9/2024 - ETFfD: What are ETFS?</h1>
<p>Basically a stock whose value is tied to a mutual fund(usually index fund)</p>
<p>Can be cheaper than index mutual funds</p>
<p>Easier to keep track of capitol gains/losses</p>
<p>Buy/Ask spread is a potential downside</p>
<p>Recurring investments are not common; reinvestments must also be manual</p>
<p>Same classes; growth, value, etc</p>
<p><a name="1/10/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/10/2024 - ETFfD: Other types of ETFs</h1>
<p>ETFs also exist for bonds, commodities, </p>
<p>Leveraged ETFS; analysis</p>
<p>Update with John; should investigate more</p>
<p><a name="1/12/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/12/2024 - ETFfD: Review</h1>
<p>Good lessons; combination of ETFs and mutual funds is ideal</p>
<p>Recurring investments and autopilot investing is probably better with mutual funds(Fidelity exception)</p>
<p>ETFs still have advantages and important to recognize and leverage</p>
<p>Again, discussions about advisors</p>
<p><a name="1/13/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/13/2024 - Bonds for Dummies</h1>
<p>Bonds are included in Mutual Funds and ETFs; would like to learn more even
if I don't intend to buy individual bonds</p>
<p>Same author as ETFs for Dummies; so I think it's good option</p>
<p><a name="1/15/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/15/2024 - BfD: Bonds and their Usage</h1>
<p>Bonds are BORING. Finally have met my match in something that can bore even me</p>
<p>Reviewing what bonds are; loans with interest rates</p>
<p>How bonds go up/down in value</p>
<p>Callability</p>
<p>Treasuresis, corporate bonds, agency bonds, municipal bonds</p>
<p><a name="1/17/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/17/2024 - BfD: Selecting Bonds and Fixed Income</h1>
<p>Understanding how to select bond funds and how much to put in bonds</p>
<p>Recognizing how to combine bonds and cash for fixed income portfolios in retirement</p>
<p><a name="1/18/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/18/2024 - Learning about the Intelligent Investor and Other Discussions</h1>
<p>Learned about Intelligent Investor book from two different friends. </p>
<p>Discussion with Brad about market timing </p>
<p>Predicting the market</p>
<p>Started reading but book seems very simple and even more boring than bonds.
Will start listening to as audiobook</p>
<p>Talking to Gus; he mainly invests in VOO instead of VTI
Also a buy and hold investor</p>
<p><a name="1/21/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/21/2024 - BfD: Review</h1>
<p>Bonds are boring, but good understanding of internals and makes it 
a bit easier to select bond funds. Probably overkill for most people
unless they want to invest in individual bonds(not advisable)</p>
<p>Bonds are only for stability; have very little use otherwise</p>
<p><a name="1/22/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/22/2024 - A Simple Path to Wealth</h1>
<p>Wanted to read this later after I learned a bit so I could approach the simple perspective with knowledge</p>
<p><a name="1/24/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/22/2024 - ASPtW: How to Become Wealthy</h1>
<p>Good, simple advice. Don't get into debt recognize how your money can grow
50% savings rate is hard; but monk parable is good
Importance of gap money
Market trends(revew)
Another overview of bonds
Asset allocation</p>
<p>Retirement. VERY good advice</p>
<p>More opinions on investment advisors</p>
<p>Very engaging book</p>
<p><a name="1/25/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/25/2024 - ASPtW: Tricks and Withdrawing</h1>
<p>Index funds; market idiots</p>
<p>Really interesting con discussion</p>
<p>Retirement; withdrawal tactics; social security(levers idea)</p>
<p>Foundation</p>
<p><a name="1/25/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/25/2024 - ASPtW: Review</h1>
<p>Excellent book; should've read first. My main rec to anybody, especially people 
who don't want to care too much</p>
<p><a name="1/31/2024"></a></p>
<h1>1/31/2024 - Intelligent Investor: Review</h1>
<p>Mostly boring and simple, but good understanding
Felt like this was the base of everything I've learned</p>
<p>Key detail about markets(I don't know and I don't care, just like ASPtW)</p>
<p><a name="2/2/2024"></a></p>
<h1>2/2/2024 - Advanced Portfolio Management</h1>
<p>Final book, interested to learn how quants and hedge funds actually work</p>
<p>Unlikely I'll actually use this but at least I can learn. May not finish book</p>
<p><a name="2/4/2024"></a></p>
<h1>2/4/2024 - APM: Factor Models</h1>
<p>Hedge funds make sense
Alpha and Beta
Previous authors don't get it, BUT risk still exists
Even though they don't get it; their advice is still decent
Multiple factors</p>
<p><a name="2/8/2024"></a></p>
<h1>2/8/2024 - APM: Incomplete Review</h1>
<p>Can see where this is going.
Multiple factors, identifying market details
Not relevant to me and I should move on
May come back later but leaving for now</p>
<p><a name="2/12/2024"></a></p>
<h1>2/12/2024 - Discussions with Another Friend</h1>
<p>Discussed with friend; generally supportive of advie but thinks I'm conservative
Mentioned leveraged etfs and talked about volitaility decay
Point about market following leverage dfunds(invested in pandemic)
Will investigate further later</p>
<p><a name="2/18/2024"></a></p>
<h1>2/18/2024 - Common Sense on Mutual Funds</h1>
<p>Book by John Bogle; started listening to audiobook like Intelligent Investor
Likely similar to Intelligent Investor; good advice and details but probably not worth read
Listen is enough; will provide review once finished to listening</p>
<p><a name="11/24/2024"></a></p>
<h1>11/24/2024 - Common Sense on Mutual Funds - Bonds</h1>
<p>It's been some time been; listening to book raises interesting point on
bond funds. Indicates bond funds are always worse than bonds in performance
Understand risks and issues with bonds but I'd like to do the mat on this myself.
I'll add it to my analysis </p></section>
