# Overview

I created my resume right after college using a LaTex template I found online.
I've been iteratively updating it since but I'm finding it doesn't communicate
my skillset well.
Making the drastic changes within the LaTex is becoming too difficult so I've 
decided to take a step back and redo my resume. I want to investigate
other ways of creating my resume to see if LaTex is still the best fit for me.
I'll start with creating a sketch of what I want my resume to look like and 
then iterate through different options.
