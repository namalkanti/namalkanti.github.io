# Overview

I created my resume right after college using a LaTex template I found online.
I became familiar with LaTex because of college assignments and liked that I
could edit the tex file in vim. The layout was pre-designed so I didn't need 
to worry about it and could focus on the content of my resume.
I've been updating it since, but I'm finding the layout doesn't communicate
my skillset well anymore.

Making the drastic changes within the LaTex is getting too cumbersome so I've 
decided to take a step back and redo my resume. I want to investigate
other ways of creating my resume to see if LaTex is still the best fit for me.
I'll start with creating a sketch of what I want my resume to look like and 
then iterate through different options. 

I work as a Research and Development engineer(mainly with Computer Vision and Software).
I have a specific layout in mind that I'd like to use but I don't need an extremely flashy
resume like a creative might. Similarly, the main distribution for my resume will be print
instead of web, so I want to focus on tools that are for the print medium.  However, it will
likely be viewed on pdf viewers so I should still consider how it presents on a screen.
I would like to include some color, but technical resumes are often printed in black and white 
so I want to make sure my resume still looks good in black and white.

## Objective
* Investigate different formats for a resume and determine which is best 
for my purposes

# 3/31/2020 - Resume Sketch
I've found that my artistic process works best when starting with some sort of sketch. 
I used to do this with pencil and paper; but after getting more familiar with inkscape,
I've begun to prefer it. Being able to move things around makes visualization and planning 
much easier; instead of constantly redrawing and erasing. I don't have a drawing tablet(and 
find it hard to justify for planning sketches) but the mouse is adequate for this. I use LibreOffice
Draw for technical and engineering diagrams but when playing with layout I prefer Inkscape.

<figure class="center">
    <img src="{attach}/images/sketch.png" width="60%" height="auto" class="border">
    <figcaption>Layout Sketch</figcaption>
</figure>

My old resume used a two column format and I started with a mock of that. I like the two column layout
because I feel it seperates information and makes it easier to read in one glance. In my (albiet limited)
experience reading resumes; employers in these fields usually use resumes as a quick heuristic to determine
whether a candidate is worth speaking to. That initial phone screen then determines whether an interview occurs.
Walls of text can be intimidating, especially if they're going through dozens of resumes. My guideline is 
if it takes longer than fives seconds to parse; it will probably be ignored. Two columns forces me to keep
my text more concise and creates a simple progression for the reader to follow.

One change I wanted to make is emphasizing work experience. The old format kept both columns the same
width. This made sense right after college; as my personal projects felt very important.
But now, my work experience is where I want emphasis, so that column will be larger. 

Something else I added was meters for my skills. The old version
only had the rating(Excellent, Good, Competent), but I like the visual touch a meter adds. 

<a name="4/1/2020"></a>
# 4/1/2020 - Google Docs

I don't think Google Docs(or any word processor) will work for me, but it's something 
that I should try. They probably don't have a template that matches 
my design and I've found that word processors are difficult to use for resumes unless 
their templates match exactly what you want.

<figure class="center">
    <img src="{attach}/images/doc.png" width="60%" height="auto" class="border">
    <figcaption>Google Docs Draft</figcaption>
</figure>

This proved to be accurate. The Google Docs Serif template was closer to what I 
wanted than I expected; but as I tried to make adjustments I found myself struggling
with the limitations of Google Docs. But the template is visually appealing.
It is unlikely that a resume designed by me will look quite as good, but
that's a trade off I'll have to make to get my desired layout.

## What I liked:
* Template looks great(at least better than what I could do)
* Templates provided me with a lot of options and ideas
* Very fast and easy to get a working resume

## What I Disliked
* Getting the specific layout I wanted seemed like an unecessary amount of work
* From experience, I know that editing the resume over time is going to be difficult

Google Docs would've been perfect if I was okay with 
selecting a template from their selection and using that. I would've gotten a professional
looking resume with minimal effort. Because of my layout needs I should look at other options. 
The next method I will try is Scribus.

<a name="Word Processor Update"></a>
### Word Processor Update  - 4/15

After reading Byfield's blog post on LibreOffice's effectiveness in desktop publishing I wanted 
to look at Google Docs to see if they have similar features I didn't know about it. 
You can't insert text boxes, but you can insert drawings and put text in them. This feels like a hack instead
of a genuine solution. After some googling and experimenting I couldn't find any good layout or alignment tools. 
There are add-ons that seem to add these features, but I don't think forcing Google Docs to do what I need is 
the best option.

<a name="4/8/2020"></a>
# 4/8/2020 - Scribus Tutorials

I've never used Scribus before so my first step will be to investigate how I might use it to
build a resume.

It was during this research that I discovered that LibreOffice might actually be a good fit.
I don't want to start a tanget here, but after trying out Scribus I will look at LibreOffice.

I found some video tutorials for scribus [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqazFFzUAPc6U1RcNRBMeCK6Hg3g_S6aN). 
I prefer video tutorials for GUI applications because I find them to be clearer than documentation or blogs. 
In addition to showing you the tool, they also show you different use cases which is always helpful. And even
when they're out of date; they often give you enough info so that you can usually figure out the updated variant from Google
or the docs. However, these tutorials are from mid 2018, which is only two years ago, as of this writing. I didn't
watch every video; only the ones I needed, but the videos were excellent. It looks like in Scribus my approach
should be to create a bunch of text frames and arrange them in the way I want.

<a name="4/9/2020"></a>
# 4/9/2020 - Zack Grossbart's Blog
The next area I want to investigate is to find if anybody also tried building their resume in Scribus and how 
that went for them. Surprisingly I found a blog post that does exactly that [here](http://www.zackgrossbart.com/hackito/resume/).

At first I thought this post was just building a resume in Scribus, but it's actually very similar to what I'm
trying to do. The author, Zack Grossbart, went through a similar desire to redo his resume after realizing
some weaknesses and went through a similar process. He discusses design decisions, assembles a layout, and then
tries out different applications. He tries OpenOffice(LibreOffice's predecssor) and then Scribus. He makes a 
resume in Scribus, but then tries InDesign and likes it a lot more. This surprised me; I know for design professionals
that InDesign is considered superior to the open source alernatives, but I expected
it to be sufficient for the rest of us. Grossbart has a similar engineering background(and open source preference)
like me, but he still felt InDesign was worth the cost.

This is a very strong recomendation, but I think I will use Scribus for this experiment. I dual boot Windows, 
but only use it for gaming and use my Linux partition for everything else. If Scribus is the best tool, 
I will use the Creative Cloud trial and then decide if InDesign is worth it for me.

Another aspect of design Grossbart emphasizes is typography; which Wikipedia defines as "the art and technique 
of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing", at the time of this writing. This 
is a not an area I had considered before, but it makes sense to do so. 

One detail I note is the post is somewhat old (2007, so 13 years old at the time of this writing). In 2007
Scribus was only 4 years old and LibreOffice was still OpenOffice. It is likely Scribus has made improvements 
since then and I know LibreOffice has. It also seems that I'm not quite as 
experienced as a designer as Grossbart. Those two details may make Scribus and/or LibreOffice better fits for me;
when compared to InDesign.

Grossbart's blog also helped me realize two tangential details. First, the font of my own blog could be 
improved. Second, his blog is also somewhat of a project blog, just like what I intend for mine. So at some 
point <a name="GrossbartAdvice"></a>I should revaluate the typography/font of my own blog. 
And I should revisit his blog as I develop mine.

<a name="4/10/2020"></a>
# 4/10/2020 - InDesign Blogs

I wanted to find more examples of blogs that describe a design process for resumes. Especially after 
Grossbart's reccomendation, I was interested to see this approach with InDesign. But I couldn't really find any...
Most blogs for InDesign were step by step tutorials showing how to build a resume in InDesign instead of a design
analysis. There were a few articles that listed off some good design principles when building a resume, but 
nothing like Grossbart's blog. It's possible that I may just have to look harder but I don't want to spend an
inordinate amount of time on this kind of preliminary research. If I find something later; I'll use it, but for
now I'm going to move on.

<a name="4/14/2020"></a>
# 4/14/2020 - Scribus

I started by importing my svg sketch into Scribus and pushed it into the background layer with some transparency.
I find doing this with sketches makes them helpful references. 

Initially, I was struggling with Scribus. I tried creating text frames but I found myself struggling to format 
my text correctly. None of the options I was 
familiar with from word processors were there. I guessed I was using Scribus incorrectly and downloaded a 
template to see what they were doing. It seems that most text formatting in Scribus is handled through something
called a "style". You're supposed to pre-design your styles and apply them to the relevant areas of text. This is
apparently a common theme in Desktop Publishing. I noted how similar this was to CSS before realizing CSS 
stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" and this is likely 
where this concept came from. I hadn't watched the Styles tutorial in the video tutorials because
I didn't know what styles were or that I needed them, but now was the time to fix that. 

<figure class="center">
    <img src="{attach}/images/scribus.png" width="100%" height="auto" class="border">
    <figcaption>Scribus Draft</figcaption>
</figure>

After learning how to use styles I very quickly came up with a simple, unpolished draft. This isn't a 
working version but it's a start that let me try out how Scribus might work. I expect to finish I would
need to finish planning out the styles and fill out the resume. However, at this point I want to make a similar
attempt in different applications. Once I decide which one is best, I will complete that version.

## What I liked:
* SVG support and layering are great
* Movable text boxes and alignment tools making it easy to generate desired layout
* Styles mean I don't have to redo work when making changes

## What I Disliked
* Not sure ....

It's hard to say there was anything I disliked about Scribus. There was a learning curve, but that's always the
case with new software. But I'd like to try LibreOffice before making a decision, maybe I'll learn something there.

# 4/15/2020 - Bruce Byfield's Work

Initially, I didn't want to try word processors for building a resume. I tried out Google Docs
and it didn't really work out. However, I found this [article](https://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Blogs/Off-the-Beat-Bruce-Byfield-s-Blog/Why-LibreOffice-Writer-is-a-Desktop-Publisher-Not-a-Word-Processor), 
that implies LibreOffice Writer is desktop publishing software. The, author, Bruce Byfield, also wrote 
a book titled <u>Designing With LibreOffice</u>. He's interviewed about this book [here](http://designingwithlibreoffice.com/interview/). 
This is his site for his book and has a link to buy or download it.  I decided this would be something to
investigate. I regularly use LibreOffice as my main word processor and if I can adapt it for my resume, it would be 
convenient. Byfield also seems to have familiarity with Scribus, so his opinion here is quite developed. 

This also motivated me to reinvestigate Google Docs. I've put my update as an addendum 
to my Google Docs entry [here](#Word Processor Update). 

I first started by reading Byfield's interview. I noted that his background is in graphic design and technical
writing; so he is a professional in layout and publishing. He, like Grossbart, also mentioned 
the importance of typography when it comes to design. He discusses the importance of styles in LibreOffice and
says they're critical to using LibreOffice well. He compares styles to variables in coding, which 
is personally, a helpful analogy. All of this would've been nice to know when using styles in Scribus.

Byfield even claims that LibreOffice Writer is better than Word as a Word Processor; and considers
it to be a mid-level Desktop Publishing Software. He references that the control isn't as fine as Scribus, but more
than powerful enough for a lot of use cases. He continues to assert that most people haven't realized that FOSS software isn't
playing catch up in this area. Considering his professional experience, this is a powerful statement. It strongly
implies that LibreOffice Writer is probably my application of choice. I'm looking forward to reading his book
and investigating this claim myself.

# 4/16/2020 - Designing With LibreOffice

I was impressed with <u>Designing with LibreOffice</u>; it's really more of a book on design than 
documentation on LibreOffice. There's even a section on slide design I should look at later. I didn't read the
book completely; I read some parts and skimmed others. I learned about styles and their use cases. It was here
that I realized that I handled Scribus incorrectly. I should have done manual formatting with text properties
and then developed the styles later. Developing them beforehand just wastes a lot of time changing unecessary
options. Byfield is a big fan of using styles and templates but recognizes when they are unecessary. Even with the
limited scope of my resume, I still think it's appropriate to use styles here. 
Styles may take time to step up, but they will make editing and maintaining my resume over time easier.

So I should start with using manual formatting to create a LibreOffice sample like my Scibus sample. Then I can
decide which application to settle on and go through Byfield's full design process. 

<a name="4/18/2020"></a>
# 4/18/2020 - LibreOffice 

Unfortunately, the first thing I noted when starting to use LibreOffice is the lack of support for layers. This
was a useful feature of Scribus that let me use my sketch as a transparent reference in the background layer.
While not necessary, it was a nice convenience. 

As I began to build out my layout I started encountering more complications.
I didn't plan on using styles for the first sample, but I wanted to make sure I knew how they worked.
But LibreOffice Writer didn't seem to have styles that I could apply to text frames. Every time I went into a
a text frame the styles wouldn't be a usable option. Searching through google, I found a mailing list [entry](https://listarchives.libreoffice.org/global/users/msg42897.html)
that indicated this didn't work and to use Insert > Frame instead. This did work and allowed me to apply styles. The
default frame was unattractive but I could easily create an ideal frame style later. To apply styles I would
just identify my text and select the style I desired. I wondered what the point was of these two different objects.
Google showed me this [question](https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/77041/frames-vs-text-boxes/). It appears
that text frames are much simpler structures with some niche use cases. The question notes you can copy text
frames in Draw or Impress but can't with frames. 

Applying styles in frames worked but it doesn't show the styles in the navigator if they're in a frame. Again, this is 
a minor inconvenience, but I now appreciate the story editor in Scribus. Having all the text content laid out
and being able to apply styles via a side bar feels like a great UI choice. Especially when 
text spans multiple boxes. Writer's navigator can do this if I type like a word processor, but not with 
frames.

<figure class="center">
    <img src="{attach}/images/writer.png" width="60%" height="auto" class="border">
    <figcaption>LibreOffice Writer Draft</figcaption>
</figure>

This is my sample document in LibreOffice. When desiging the layout, I found the 
alignment tool in LibreOffice isn't quite as good as in Scribus. I can set anchors to certain objects(like frames),
but not other objects I've drawn. I also can't select both my drawing and frame and align that way(this is how Draw
does it). I can come up with work arounds for my sample but it's something else to note.

## What I liked:
* Lots of premade styles that can be easily edited
* Integration with LibreOffice Draw makes it easy to draw and add simple images
* Odf has some overlap with Microsoft Word and Google Docs

## What I Disliked
* No layers support
* Alignment tools don't work well with images

LibreOffice's familiarity is attractive, but I struggle a lot when creating my desired layout. The 
question will likely be whether it's worth struggling with LibreOffice to use a familiar application.

# 4/19/2020 - Revisiting Latex

Ah yes, Latex, we meet again. When I started this project, I honestly expected to try out some GUI applications
and then find that Latex was still the best choice. My impression was that GUI applications were mainly for 
ease of use. However, my investigations with Scribus and LibreOffice have shown
that was just my ignorance. Desktop Publishing Software has plenty of features to allow for formatting and allow
me to focus on content; which is supposed to be the selling point of Latex. I still need to learn more about 
desktop publishing, but I know typesetting my desired layout in Latex will also take an  
indeterminate amount of time.
As I've been using a pre-made Latex template for my old resume, I already have an estimate of how difficult it 
will be to typeset, even though I've not made an entry in this blog.

The biggest draw to Latex right now, is I can use vim to edit my Latex files. I still prefer to use vim for text
documents and I can't use it in LibreOffice or Scibus. But I don't think this minor idiosyncracy is enough to
justify using Latex. So I will throw out Latex as option.

The other thing I've realized is that Scribus's story editor is similar to Latex; in which you focus
on content and annotate the content. It annoyed me at first, but approaching it from a Latex 
perspective helps me appreciate it more.

<a name="4/22/2020"></a>
# 4/22/2020 - The Decision 
At the beginning of this project, I started with a bias towards Latex. But after learning
about LibreOffice's DTP capabilities and how styles can help with formatting; I began to consider it 
the frontrunner application. Now, after 
trying it out; it doesn't quite have what I need. I had to resort to workarounds to get 
the layout I wanted and I almost considered dealing
with them to use LibreOffice. But LibreOffice doesn't handle drawings with layout well. I can
make some workarounds with frames but drawings don't align easily to each other. I want to keep my resume 
simple, but having small images and lines adds a nice visual flair. In the case of the meters for skills; they actually
aid in rapid understanding of my resume. I don't want to give these up so I won't be happy with LibreOffice.
I'll have to use Scibus; the unlikely dark horse in the competition

It might seem unusual that I'm so fixated on LibreOffice or that Scribus is the "dark horse". In the "What I Liked"
it seems like Scribus is a clear winner. But there was a critical aspect of my selection process that it didn't 
make sense to discuss before. A resume is not a one time document. I will have to make edits and updates over time.
And I may want to change and alter the layout occasionally as well. I have no interest in further Desktop Publishing
right now so the only use case I have for Scribus is my resume. That means I wont really stay up to date
with the application. I'll likely have to have some sort of "Scribus Review" every time I want to 
make non trivial changes(layout and/or formatting) to my resume. Hopefully, this wont be too frequent, but 
it doesn't compare well to LibreOffice.

I have been using Word Processors since a very early age and feel familiar with them. It'll take some time to 
adapt this workflow of using styles but it's not an extreme shift. LibreOffice Writer is going to be
an application I use regularly for most other documents. This would give me a familiarity with the tool which is
preferable if I'm using it to maintain my resume. I wouldn't really need any kind of review with LibreOffice. If 
anything my resume work would help my ability to use LibreOffice for other kinds of work. Because of this I was 
willing to put up with some workarounds to stick with a tool that I can develop skill with. But I should only 
compromise so much; if it's not the right tool, I should just use the right one.

I mentioned earlier that if I chose Scribus; I would also consider InDesign. But when I went to investigate
the cost of InDesign, I found that its $240/year(April 2020). I mentioned I don't plan on doing more DTP so
this $240/yr is effectively a "resume upkeep" cost. This is far too much for me to consider. I note that when Grossbart
selected InDesign as his preferred application; it was still a purchase, not a subscription. Even if I do prefer InDesign
I can't justify this cost so I'm not even going to bother to try it.

I think the design principles in Byfield's book will still be useful and I will try to follow it if I can. 
I think my workflow should be to fill out sample content and then pick some fonts initially. Then I'll manually format
to my liking before converting everthing into styles. Finally, I'll polish up the layout.

<a name="4/28/2020"></a>
# 4/28/2020 - Finishing Sample Content 
I want to start by filling out the fake content of my resume. The content is relevant to my layout so I can't
just use latin filler text. Seeing where details about different resume entries are and how they
present is critical. But I didn't want to fill everything out until I knew which 
application I was settling on. 
I also didn't want to use my actual information. I knew I would focus too much on the content
so I decide to use Batman. I can create fake, but purposeful entries based on my background knowledge of Batman.
This isn't going to be completely accurate but it should serve my purpose. Once the sample text is done, I can pick
out an initial set of fonts. Then I can finish manual formatting, layout, and styling. 

<figure class="center">
    <img src="{attach}/images/sample_content.png" width="60%" height="auto" class="border">
    <figcaption>Resume populated with fake sample content</figcaption>
</figure>

This is the initial draft of the sample. I doubt it's accurate or thorough but it should give me an initial start
for the relevant design aspects of my resume.

<a name="5/03/2020"></a>
# 5/03/2020 - Picking Initial Fonts
Now that I've put in some sample content I'd like to pick some fonts to start with. 
I want to start with some direction for fonts before I continue the layout.

Byfield has an entire chapter on font selection. I would suggest reading the entire
chapter as there is a lot of good information, but I'm only going to discuss aspects
directly relevant to me and this project. 
Byfield starts by describing font families
and font styles. There are several different font families, but I'm likely to only 
really consider Serif and Sans Serifs. 

<figure class="center">
    <img src="{attach}/images/font_families.png" width="60%" height="auto">
    <figcaption>Serif and Sans Serif examples</figcaption>
</figure>

The main difference between the two is Serif fonts have tails on the letters that's 
supposed to make theme easier to read. Byfield mentions a lot of heuristics with the two
families; such as Serifs being more common for body text in print. Sans Serifs are 
supposedly more "modern" and look better on screens. He also mentions that font
selecion is more of
an art instead of a science so I'll probably have just have to try a bunch of fonts 
and see what sticks. 

He also talks about fonts styles(bold, italic, etc.) but mentions these are very
unstandarized. It's probably not even worth for me to consider this detail analytically
and I should probably just eyeball different styles and see what looks nice.

Another point Byfield makes is that the convention is to use two different fonts.
One for headings and one for body text; more tends to draw too much attention to document
design instead of content. I originally considered using a thid eye-catching font just for
my name and resume title. But I think the point is valid, so I will try to stick to two.

There's a lot of information on selecting different fonts but at this point I want to
just start looking at fonts and see what I like. One aspect
Byfield mentions is to select fonts that are "similar" to each other. This is a difficult
thing to determine, but one method he suggests is to select fonts by the same designer.
After searching for free fonts on google, I found a group of fonts all by the same
designer, Matt Ellis, that I like. The fonts are made freely available so I shouldn't
run into any legal issues. 


<figure class="center">
    <img src="{attach}/images/font_options.png" width="80%" height="auto">
</figure>

Arciform Sans is the clear standout for me and after trying it out I easily selected it
for the resume content.
Alcubierre is very popular and suggested for titles but the font feels a little too thin.
None of these fonts have bold or italic styles so I can't use those options. 
Athene feels a little wispy on my screen; so I don't think I'll use that either. Arctic
is a nice font but I really don't like the v letter. V isn't an extremely common letter,
though, so I'll keep Arctic in mind as a backup.

Ikaros looked very promising but the tail on the capital P feels too short.

<figure class="center">
    <img src="{attach}/images/capital_p.png" width="40%" height="auto">
    <figcaption>Capital P in Ikaros</figcaption>
</figure>

I do intend of using "P" in the "Personal Project" heading so, unlike the v in Arctic, the
capital P is important. 
I can't believe I'm being so picky over such pedantic details, but I guess that's design.

While considering other fonts; I happened to look at my blog more closely. At this point,
I've taken Grossbart's [advice](#GrossbartAdvice) and updated my blog's font. The font 
is, at the time of writing, Ubuntu. This is a free font that has a similar "curvature"
to Ellis's fonts. It also has more styles available, which is nice to have for headings.

<figure class="center">
    <img src="{attach}/images/ubuntu_sample.png" width="80%" height="auto">
</figure>

I tried this out and find that I like it. For the moment, I'm italicizing the headings
but I may change that later.

The final point of discussion is what Byfield refers to as the "color" of the page. This 
does not correspond to a physical color, but how light or dark the font appears. This
seems to be primarily based on font size and line spacing. This is useful, however, because
once line spacing is determined, it can be used as a "magic number" to guide other aspects
of the doucment. Byfield mentions this process can take a lot of experimentation but
has some guidelines listed.

After experimenting I decided to use a 14pt font for the content, 16 pt for the headings,
28 pt for the title, and 22 pt for the subtitle. Arciforms Sans is a bit of a smaller font
so the increased size makes sense. I'm using 15 pt line spacing for the content. This is 
all subject to change but should give me a nice starting point.

<figure class="center">
    <img src="{attach}/images/scribus_fonts.png" width="60%" height="auto" class="border">
    <figcaption>Current Resume sample with fonts</figcaption>
</figure>

Something I think is really important to mention is how incredibly useful styles were
for this entire process. Despite still being in the "design" phase, I set the default 
character style to the body font and made a second one for the heading I applied to the 
headings and title. This allowed me to quickly experiment with different fonts/sizes and see

changing large blocks of text and the workflow felt great.
