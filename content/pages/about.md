Title: about

WORK IN PROGRESS

I made this blog to write about my different attempts with projects. 
I feel that most people(both in blogs and academia) only publich positive results.
For this blog I want to write about all my projects, including the failures. 
Time spent on my projects tends to vary as other priorities come up in life so 
it's unlikely that I'll be consistent with my updates but I hope these posts will be helpful to somebody.

Mitigating  failure is because I feel that failure isn't something to be rid of but simply reduced.
We learn the most from our failures

I have three categories; Lab, Workshop, and Studio. This comes from a video game, XCOM. 
The Lab is meant for ideas and concepts 
Workshop is meant for actual products or devices I plan on using
Studio is for art projects

Projects will have different stages
In Progress
Partial Success
Complete
Stalled
