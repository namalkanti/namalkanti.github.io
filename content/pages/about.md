WORK IN PROGRESS

I made this blog to write about my different attempts with projects. 
I feel that most people(both in blogs and academia) only publich positive results.
For this blog I want to write about all my projects, including the failures. 

I have three categories; Lab, Workshop, and Studio. This comes from a video game, XCOM. 
The Lab is meant for ideas and concepts 
Workshop is meant for actual products or devices I plan on using
Studio is for art projects
