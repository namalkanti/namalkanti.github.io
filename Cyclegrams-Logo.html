<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>I've been building an android app for a project idea I had. 
As I mentioned in the about section; I won't always make entries 
for my projects. I don't plan on distributing this app 
on the app store, but I plan to use the app myself. I want to use 
a different logo than the default app logo, and so this 
is a good opportunity to try logo design.</p>
<p>I've never designed a logo before, but I would like to design a 
personal one in the future. The lack of distribution makes this 
a good, low pressure project 
to try out first.</p>
<p>Even this wouldn't necessarily be a good reason for a blog post, 
but I've always been interested in the idea of using git for 
version control with design. Since inkscape uses svg(a text file)
as its default file format; this feels like a good place to try it out.</p>
<p>Since the main goal of this project is to make a usable logo, 
I'm listing it as a studio project. I'll first go into 
detail about the app then git.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Design logo for Cyclegrams app</li>
<li>Practice logo design </li>
<li>See how useful git is as design version control with inkscape</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="app"></a></p>
<h1>Cyclegrams</h1>
<p>The app idea is based on a form of journaling I've been doing for 
the past few years. You have 366 notecards(one for each day of the 
year plus leap day) and on each corresponding day you add a one line 
entry for the current year. I like this because it allows me to reflect 
and gives me easy access to past entries. Unlike an actual journal; you 
don't get caught in some massive nostalgia binge every time you look back 
through your entries. It's roughly a five minute reflection process; 
since each entry is one line. Social media can do this to an extent; but 
it isn't as comprehensive(only when you post or upload pictures). I find 
it much easier to write one sentence about my day than upload a photo 
per day. And I don't always want this info to be public so social media 
is out of the question anyways.</p>
<p>My main problem with this is how I'm implementing it. Having to carry 
around a giant stack of notecards isn't ideal. And each of these cards 
are valuable; even losing one would be frustrating. But this lends itself 
naturally to a phone app. I can store the data locally, but back up the 
database. And having your phone with you most of the time is almost a 
requirement nowadays.</p>
<p>I've never built an android app before so this is a new experience for me. 
But unlike, say, OpenSCAD, there are already a lot of tutorials for 
building apps online. And I'm not exactly doing anything novel here; it's 
a pretty simple app. So I didn't see any point to making a blog post on 
the app itself. I'll work on the app concurrently with the logo design 
process. I find context switching between technical and creative topics 
is mentally refreshing for me; though this will probably result in large
time gaps between entries.</p>
<p><a name="git"></a></p>
<h1>Git</h1>
<p>Version control seems like it would be useful for the creative design process. In the past I've always
made different save copies but this is ugly and gets annoying. Using version control, branching, and tags
all seem like great ways to keep track of history and different iterations.</p>
<p>I've tried discussing this with others and have gotten mixed results. Some claim it would be useful, but
its difficult to use. This is fair; I'm not sure how strong current VC offerings are from
Adobe and other creative companies. And I don't think most creatives are comfortable with git or svn. 
Implementing vc for binary files is still considered non-trivial. Some companies support it, but it's not
as easy or natural as with text files. And most VC is still focused on software projects.</p>
<p>Other claim vc is unecessary. Good use of non-destructive editing and layers means you can rebuild your design
to any previous iteration without saves. I've heard that Adobe also has a perpetual undo feature which
is helpful for retrieving old versions. I definitely agree that learning to design correctly with layers
is important and version control shouldn't be a crutch to avoid this.</p>
<p>But at the same time; I don't feel that the latter group has given version control a fair shot, mostly because
they can't. It doesn't feel like there are any strong VC methods for creative projects. Most seem 
far more trouble than they are worth. But with inkscape there might be some potential. Inkscape uses a 
text file(svg) as it's main file format. I can simply use a typical programming version control
system; git being my preference. </p>
<p>I should point out that my goal here is to evaluate how useful git is as a version control for design for ME.
I'm not a creative and have a nearly orthogonal skillset to them. I have no way of evaluating whether it will
be helpful for creatives in general. But it is easy to determine how useful git will be to me and others
can read and evaluate this process for their own skillsets, should they care.</p>
<p>But, at the very least, I should look into how people online have used version control for design. I've not
found information on this previously, but I also havent explicitly looked for it either.</p>
<p><a name="8/09/2020"></a></p>
<h1>8/09/2020 - Initial Version Control Scouting</h1>
<p>First, I spoke to a friend of mine in graphic design. She actually made a good point. She typically
has an idea in mind when approaching a design; so branching and tagging isn't necessary. This makes
sense and is something to keep in mind when I'm using vc for myself.</p>
<p>I found a few articles discussing VC for designers but they all seem old. There used to be 
a tool called PixelNow, which was a gui wrapper for SVN. Adobe also had a VC system called Cue. I can't
actually find PixelNow anymore, but Cue seems to have been integrated into Adobe's Creative Cloud. CC
saves a history of file version and you can mark different version with names and save them from 
deletion. This sounds like it does the bulk of what VC offers and since it's built into CC; it's easy
to use.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.somewhatcreative.net/design/5-great-version-control-software-for-graphic-designers/">site</a>
has a list of version control solutions for creatives. Some of these are baked into applications but
some are standalone products. These look similar to Adobe's in built solution. The main thing they add
is collaboration. I don't have the bandwith to test these out myself, but it's worth noting that there
do seem to be lots of VC solutions for creatives. So my initial conjecture appears to be incorrect, something
also worth noting.</p>
<p>This last <a href="https://opensource.com/life/16/2/version-control-isnt-just-programmers">article</a>, actually has
a designer using Mercurial. They even explicitly mention that Svgs when using inkscape is an excellent use
case. While old(2016), it implies that designers actually tend to ignore VC and the article
suggests using VC for creative projects. That implies that even though VC exists for designers,
it's not really used(these are just a few samples; so take this all with a grain of salt). This could be
because it's not actually useful. Or people don't want to try new things. Or something else I'm not thinking of.
But most of this is academic; I'm not a creative, so our skillsets/objectives may not support the same 
workflows anyways, and I don't need to focus too much on this</p>
<p>But my friend's point; that having a strong design goal in mind may limit the usefulness of VC, is definitely
something to remember.</p>
<p><a name="12/29/2020"></a></p>
<h1>12/29/2020 - Initial Sketch</h1>
<p>I began with a quick initial sketch. I don't have a drawing tablet so I did this with my mouse.</p>
<figure class="center">
    <img src="https://mitigatingfailure.com/cglogo_sketch.png" width="60%" height="auto" class="border">
    <figcaption>First Logo Sketch</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This obviously isn't very good. But the idea I'm going for is a letter surrounded by a "cycle" circle.
This feels like a nice simple logo that's vaguely related to what my app does. It also should go nicely
with the circular icons I use on my phone.</p>
<p><a name="1/24/2021"></a></p>
<h1>1/24/2021 - First Attempt</h1>
<p>I started by trying to create the circle with an arrow. I first tried creating a circle and was going
to align an arrow on it but I realized this wouldn't work with just black and white colors. I was taught
to initially design a logo in black and white(helps with color design and seperation) and so running into
this issue so quickly wasn't promising. I then tried to use a "C" letter from a sans serif font as a base. 
This would give me a little seperation between the arrow and the loopback.</p>
<figure class="center">
    <img src="https://mitigatingfailure.com/cglogo_arciform_circle.png" width="60%" height="auto" class="border">
    <figcaption>Current State</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But as I review the app logos on my phone, I feel that continuing with my design would result in one that
is way too busy. Even if I thin out the C; it feels like there will be too much going on inside with the 
mail graphic. I think I'd like to rethink my approach. </p>
<p><a name="2/10/2021"></a></p>
<h1>2/10/2021 - Rethinking my Design</h1>
<p>My sketch idea wasn't bad but since app logos are so small I think it'll be
a little too busy with the lines for the letter. </p>
<p>So let's take a step back. Instead of thinking so literally, what's the first 
thing I think of when I hear cyclegrams? For cycle I think of a bicycle. 
Gram may reference a message in this 
case but when I hear gram I think of those tiny gram weights we used in 
high school science classes. Maybe I can try combining these two instant
thoughts?</p>
<figure class="center">
    <img src="https://mitigatingfailure.com/wheel_weight.png" width="60%" height="auto" class="border">
    <figcaption>Current State</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Again this isn't very good, but it's basically a trapezoid with a spoked wheel where the weight hook should
be. This is a relatively simple design(I may have to play with the number of lines in the wheel), but I can't
find anything similar. The closest would be logos that use the same weight concept but they don't 
have spoked wheels as hooks.</p>
<p>Since I'm taking a new direction with my ideas, this looks a great oppurtunity to use branching. And git
makes this easy with a simple git branch command. I kept the original sketch in a hidden, renamed layer but
if I decide this direction is a dead end; I can just revert to master instead of reconstructing my original
project with layers.</p>
<p><a name="2/13/2021"></a></p>
<h1>2/13/2021 - First SVG</h1>
<figure class="center">
    <img src="https://mitigatingfailure.com/first_svg.png" width="60%" height="auto" class="border">
    <figcaption>First SVG</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This isn't too bad. I'm not going to win any logo design awards, but it's simple. I'm also not going to mix it
up with another app, and it should still work even when it's shrunk down to an app logo size. </p>
<p>My next step will be to colorize it. I have some idea of how I want to approach this. I'll probably use a 
light teal for the weight fill and a soft beige for the wheel spokes. The weight fill should be easy but
the wheel spokes aren't an object I can fill; so I'll have to be a little more clever with that.</p>
<p><a name="3/2/2021"></a></p>
<h1>3/2/2021 - First Draft</h1>
<figure class="center">
    <img src="https://mitigatingfailure.com/cglogo_draft.png" width="50%" height="auto">
    <figcaption>First Draft</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So this is the first draft. I ended up changing the wheel spokes to a cross pattern
because I like the visibility of the cross when scaling the logo. 
The coloration was what I expected but I ended up not liking how the wheel
just kind of jutted out from the top. It also didn't feel like it scaled well when resizing. 
So I ended up moving the wheel to the center of the weight. This does feel extremely simple
but I think this is still unique enough(especially for a personal app logo that will not be
distributed). </p>
<p>The final change I made was to remove the dot in the center. I'm not exactly sure why I prefer it.
It might be because the black and white structure of the logo is primarily negative space so having 
a small filled part in the center feels inconsistent? I'm not really sure; I'm just stringing together
artistic sounding words in a way that sounds correct. But I do prefer this logo and will consider it for
my first draft.</p>
<p>At this point, I'd like to let my mind "sit" for a few days and review this later. If I'm still okay with
it then I will consider the logo design finished.</p>
<p><a name="3/5/2021"></a></p>
<h1>3/5/2021 - Review</h1>
<p>Well I've thought about it for a few days and I think I'm going to go forward with this.</p>
<p>Obviously, it's not "perfect". It feels too simple and I'm worried it may not be unique enough.
But since I want a simple logo, it seems aggressive to criticize it for being "too simple". The
lack of uniqueness isn't critical since I'm not distributing this in any way. I usually find
that I never consider my art projects to be "perfect" and I'm told this is fairly common.</p>
<p>Apparently the wheel plus design I used is a very common design called a sun cross. Despite this,
a sun cross in a trapezoidal shape like mine doesn't appear to be an existing logo so I should be okay.</p>
<p>The next step would be to merge my branch back into main since I'm going to select this as my 
main logo. Since I never made any changes to master this ended up being utterly trivial and not
a real test of git in this context. I did try making some small changes but wasn't able to 
create any major merge conflict. And I didn't think artificially trying too hard 
to create a merge conflict was a good way to practically test git.</p>
<p>At this point I will mark this project as stalled. I don't want to declare it finished until
I see the logo in my app; I will probably make some minor adjustments at that point. But I've
been making poor progress in my app development and am unsure when I'll get around to finishing
it.</p>
<p>However, I can make an assessment of git at this point and will do so before moving to finish the
app.</p>
<p><a name="3/6/2021"></a></p>
<h1>3/6/2021 - Git Assessment</h1>
<p>After a bit of consideration I think Git is a good fit for me in these kinds of projects.</p>
<p>I didn't get the chance to truly test git with some sort of esoteric merge conflicts but what
I did get to see is promising. The xml structure of svg seems to be very intelligently designed. 
It's actually based on the concept of layers and each layer is a top level xml tag. So all of my
changes looked coherent in the xml. </p>
<p>Even if this isn't a strong case for git, it's worth nothing the effort of using git here was 
non-existent. I'm so fluent in git from work/personal projects, simply making commits with 
comments is trivial. The "design 
log" this ends up creating is probably more than worth the marginal effort of using git. Even
if branching and merging turns out to be more trouble than it's worth, the git history and logs
are sufficient.</p>
<p>So my evaluation is that I will continue to use git when working on inkscape projects. If I end
up changing my mind about this later, I will amend this entry.</p></section>
